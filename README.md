## Instructions

This project took the initial starting page HTML and CSS files and modified them, along with the JavaScript file, to create an interactive landing page.  

The page dynamically builds a navigation bar based on the number of sections in the HTML document.  As sections are added or deleted from the HTML the navigation bar (and related scrolling) will be updated on the page without modifying any of the JavaScript.

The text content of the <h2> element in each <section> tag is what gets populated as the name of the links in the navigation bar.  Clicking the link in the nav bar brings the user to the corresponding section.  As the user scrolls up/down the page the various sections become "active" as they scroll closer to the top of the page.  

Additionally there is a "Go To Top" button that appears when the user has scrolled down a certain amount (or a section has been linked to via the nav bar) which allows the user to return to the top of the page.  When the top of the page is displayed this button is hidden.
